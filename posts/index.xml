      <description>I have long hesitated to order an analysis of my genome. I found it interesting to learn more about myself through genome.

In this article I explain how I had my genome analyzed, I give some advice to protect your personal data as much as possible, and how I proceeded to manually do a much deeper analysis of the raw genome data.</description>
